# CPE

CPE is a small terminal programming agent built with Bubble Tea, gai, Starlarkx,
and Dyson. The model has one tool: a persistent `starlark_repl`. It uses Starlark
functions to read and write files, run commands, call HTTP services, and invoke
application-supplied tools or MCP servers.

## Agent Plugins

CPE installs native [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/specification)
packages from Git repositories. For example, install Stripe's plugin into the
current project:

```sh
cpe plugins install stripe/ai --path providers/agent-plugins/plugin --scope project
cpe plugins list --scope project
cpe plugins remove stripe --scope project
```

Use `--scope global` for `~/.agents/plugins`. Project scope defaults to
`./.agents/plugins`; `--dir` selects an exact custom directory instead.
`--plugin NAME` selects by manifest name, while `--path` selects an exact
source-relative package directory. `--override` replaces an existing bundle,
including removal of obsolete files.

Installation preserves skills, MCP configuration, and bundled resources without
running code, connecting to MCP servers, or signing into Stripe. Component
problems are reported as warnings without discarding the bundle. Results are
JSON arrays when stdout is redirected; `--json` also forces JSON on a terminal.

Verify changes with `go test ./...` and `go run ./build lint`.
