I need your help in creating a AGENT.md file.

## Specification

The AGENT.md file SHOULD be placed in the root directory and MUST use Markdown formatting. The file SHOULD contain the
following sections:

- Project structure and organization
- Build, test, and development commands
- Code style and conventions
- Architecture and design patterns
- Testing guidelines
- Security considerations

The format is designed to be human-readable while providing structured information that can be parsed by agentic coding
tools.

### File References

AGENT.md files MAY reference other files using @-mentions (e.g., @filename.md) to include additional context or
documentation that should be considered when working in the project.

## AGENT.md Content Structure
What should be in your AGENT.md? Think about what you'd tell a new team member on their first day. Here's what works:

- **Project Overview**: Brief description of the project's purpose and architecture
- **Build & Commands**: Development, testing, and deployment commands
- **Code Style**: Formatting rules, naming conventions, and best practices
- **Testing**: Testing frameworks, conventions, and execution guidelines
- **Security**: Security considerations and data protection guidelines
- **Configuration**: Environment setup and configuration management

Create an AGENT.md file based on these guidelines.
